// Layouts - header
//
// The layout styling for major parts of the page  are created 'mobile-first' using the benefits of flexbox and cssgrid,
// declaring appropriate fallback's where the technology is not widely enough implemented in currently used web
// browsers. We utilise auto-prefixer to help in this regard to ensure that when prefixing for a declaration is required
// for a particular vendor that the developer need not be concerned with making sure this is done.
//
// As NICS has comparatively few variations in layouts, therefore layouts can be covered with relatively little code.
// This section of the styleguide is essentially broken into 2 main areas - common classes and utilities that are
// required and used for layout, then there are a series of individual layouts.
